# Google Colab example runs for the project.

- Naive_knn.ipnyb : Whole syllable KNN. 

- Segmentwise_knn.ipynb : Segment_wise KNN

- Analysis.ipynb : Analysis of the KNN results.

Note that the KNNs take a long time (maybe over a full day) to perform. If you wish to only see the results, running only Analysis.ipynb will be enough.
