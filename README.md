# Birdsong_Continuity

Project to statistically see if the mapping from the neural space to the spectral(behavioral) space is continuous.


To set up directories and download data, run:
```
bash setup.sh
```
Further preprocessing is required before running KNN. Refer to the folder 'example_runs' to see how preprocessing is done.

To load the KNN results, run:
```
bash load_results.sh
```
Again, example code to analyze the results are in the folder 'example_runs'.
